# Project to increase revenue for an online store
In the following project, our global task is to find the best way to increase the online store's revenue. We have a list of hypotheses provided by the marketing department. We prioritize the hypotheses according to the RICE and ICE frameworks and then make an A/B test for the hypothesis with the highest priority. During conducting A/B testing, we will proceed with standard steps for analyzing the received data:

Evaluate the cumulative data (check, revenue, conversion) and build the necessary graphs;
Define abnormal data (too high order cost or too many orders);
Calculate the statistical significance of differences for all data and for filtered data;
Draw conclusions based on the obtained data;
Decide whether to continue or stop the A/B test.

To proceed with the analysis, we use a dataset with information about the hypotheses proposed by the marketing department; a dataset with data on completed orders (transaction number, user ID, amount, order time, testing group); a dataset with information about a/b testing groups.

A brief conclusion based on the project: the hypothesis that adding a subscription form on all main pages will bring benefits to the company was not confirmed.

An A/B test can be stopped.

In this project, we used pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy libraries.
